This data is a record of meteorological measurements from the
University of Reading weather station from the 4th September 2014 onwards.
It provides hourly measurements of:
Td: Dry bulb temperature
RH: Relative humidity
Sdur: Accumulated sunshine since 0000UTC
Rain_accum_der: Accumulated rainfall since 0000UTC
P: Station pressure
U10: 10m wind speed

The data is stored in the .csv format, readable using e.g. numpy in
Python, the pandas library in Python, or in R, or whatever you like.

Missing data is represented by blank entries i.e. the empty string.

THE CHALLENGE FOR THIS DATASET

Your challenge is to provide a prediction of these values at 1200UTC
on Wednesday 20th March. You should also quantify your uncertainty in
this estimate: provide a variance for the each of the values in your
estimate, or a covariance if you like.  The score for your prediction
will be proportional to the negative log-likelihood of the true value
given your prediction i.e. proportional to

(x - x_T)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-x_T)

where \Sigma is the covariance matrix for the uncertainty in your
estimate (we will construct a diagonal matrix from your individual
variances if you use those), x is your vector of 6 predictions, and
x_T is the true value.

You should submit your predictions by 3pm Tuesday 19th March by adding
the data to a public fork of this repository on Github (the same fork
should be used for all three challenges in your group) and sending the
SHA of the commit to colin.cotter@imperial.ac.uk.

To make this prediction, you may use the data in this csv file, which
you can refresh from https://metdata.reading.ac.uk/cgi-bin/MODE3.cgi
by selecting "1-hour WMO-standard processed output" and selecting the
appropriate variables. You may also make use of any other publically
available datasets and forecasts. You might also find the following
useful:
* A dataset of ensemble forecasts from ECMWF for a gridpoint near Reading
http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~pt904209/pub/farnborough.tar.gz
* The same for grid points from Benson and Heathrow
http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~pt904209/pub/farnborough_benson_heathrow.tar.gz


We would like you to present your prediction strategy to us in the
3pm-5pm presentation slot on Tuesday 19th March
